# SQL-R
# SQL Project
This is a Film Inventory database project where I have created a Film inventory database and created various queries to extract data from that database.

## Prerequisites
I have used MySQL Workbench 8.0 and RDS database from the Amazon Web Services for creating the initial connection with MySQL server.

## Files
The FilmInventoryDB_schema.sql file consists of all the scripts of creating the database and tables along with the constraints. It also includes the creation of views and stored procedures. I have created Triggers on insert, update and delete functions also. Further it includes the various queries for extracting data in different forms from the tables using GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY commands alongwith various JOINS.

The FilmInventoryEERD.mwb is the ER diagram or data model for this project. I have also attached a pdf version for the same for users convenience. (FilmInventoryEERD.pdf)

The MoviesRatingVisualization.docx is the text version of the R script uploaded for user convenience.
